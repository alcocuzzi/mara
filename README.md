**Optional: Create a wrapper script**
By creating a wrapper script it makes easier to run the `Mara` container and access computer folders your preferable code editor.

In order to create the wrapper script, please follow the below steps:

- Create a file called `mara` in /usr/local/bin/

- Paste the following content in the file using your preferable text editor:

```console
#!/bin/bash

UID=$(id -u)
GID=$(id -g)

mkdir -p ${HOME}/devbox
image=thecoderepublic/mara:latest
docker pull ${image}

docker run \
   -it \
   --name=mara \
   --rm \
   -u $UID:$GID \
   -v ${HOME}/devbox:/home/mara/devbox \
   ${image}
```

- Make the mara file executable:
```console
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mara
```

- Every time you would like to use the tool, just type it:
```console
mara
```

From now on, use any code editor to open ${HOME}/devbox folder and store code there, and enjoy `Mara` facilities.
